### Long Description

Seeker is a sophisticated cybersecurity tool designed to demonstrate the potential data exposure when users interact with untrusted web content. It functions by hosting a deceptive web page that mimics legitimate location-based services to request geolocation permissions. When permission is granted, it captures precise GPS coordinates and a comprehensive suite of device and network information directly from the target's browser. This project serves as an educational proof of concept, highlighting the critical importance of understanding and managing browser permissions, and the risks of clicking unknown links.

### Core Features

*   **High-Precision Geolocation:** Captures accurate longitude, latitude, altitude, and direction primarily via the device's GPS hardware, offering far greater precision than standard IP-based geolocation.
*   **Comprehensive Device Fingerprinting:** Gathers extensive device details including Canvas Fingerprint ID, hardware specs (CPU, RAM, GPU), screen resolution, OS, browser version, and both public and local IP addresses.
*   **Automated Reconnaissance:** Performs automatic IP address reconnaissance upon data receipt to enrich the gathered intelligence with additional network context.
*   **Customizable Deception:** Supports multiple, realistic website templates (e.g., Google Drive, WhatsApp, Zoom) and provides a framework for creating new ones to adapt to various social engineering scenarios.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Compatible with various platforms including Termux, Linux distributions, and Docker, and supports integration with tunneling services and optional Telegram/webhook notifications for remote data capture.
